# SpaceWar
SpaceWar is a mini-game that consists of a spaceship that must avoid colliding with asteroids, either by dodging or destroying them. The peculiarity of SpaceWar is that the ship is not controlled by keyboard or with a common joystick, but is controlled by an accelerometer. In my case, I used the accelerometer that comes included in the low cost development board FRDM-KL25Z.
